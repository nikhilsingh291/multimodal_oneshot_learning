# multimodal_oneshot_learning

This repository is a placeholder for my ongoing work on using Siamese style network to understand ecommerce listings with image and textual data.

I plan to concatenate image and text embedding and feed to a simaese network.
Inspired and triggered by [Shopee - Price Match Guarantee](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching).
Open to collaborations and input.
